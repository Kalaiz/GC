    been exploring and traveling around the world. It has been something which has been done throughout the era and there will be
     done in years to come.According to a recent survey by <a href="https://www.realtymogul.com/resource-center/articles/young-people-aren-t-buying-homes-because-they-d-rather-travel-the-world-0">Realty Mogul</a>,
      47 percent of young people between the ages of 18 and 34 would rather spend their money on traveling than buying a house.

   Reflection
    </h2>
    <p> Upon building this website,I have learned a numerous lot of things  not only about
        HTML and  CSS ,but also I think I have learned to decipher a bit of  javascript codes and online sources which uses high leveled 
        and complex HTML codes.Creating a website is an art, which requires patience and sometimes could require tedious work,but it can reap worthy benefits.Websites are critical mode of communication is this modern era as everyone is connected through internet,and websites are the fundamental blocks of it.
     </p><br/>
    <p>Furthermore,With the upcoming of services which help creating websites,learning HTML and CSS might seem unecessary;but we must remember that to configure or customise one's website to his/her own liking,it is wiser to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
