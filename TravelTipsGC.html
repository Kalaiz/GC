        <ul>  
            <li><p><b>Be frugal — but not cheap.</b> Look for deals and don’t waste money, 
                   but  at the same time don’t miss out on places you could visit  by wasting time on walking to save a couple of dollars.
                   Time is money. Spend them both wisely.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Book flights 3-4 months in advance to get the best price.</b> And don’t drive yourself too crazy trying 
                   to get the absolute cheapest fare.
                   Spending five hours to try to save $10 will cause you a lot of stress.</p> </li>
            <li><p><b>Try new food. Don’t ask what it is.</b> Just put it in your mouth and see if you like it. 
                      If you put your guard up,
                      you might miss out on some unusual and delicious local cuisine.</p> </li>
            <li><p>
                 <b>Don’t overplan your trip. Let your days unfold naturally.</b> Schedule two or three things and
                 let the day fill in the rest on its own. It’s less stressful,
                 and letting the day just take you is one of the best ways to travel.</p> </li>
            <li><p><b>Get travel insurance. Don’t be too frugal.</b> If something goes wrong, you don’t want to have
                   thousands of dollars in bills.
                  Travel insurance is the most important thing you get that you never want to use if you are travelling often.</p> </li>
            <li><p><b>Stash Extra Cash</b>
                Cash is king around the world. To cover you up  in an emergency, make sure to stash some in a 
                few different places. I recommend at least a couple hundred dollars worth. If you lose your wallet,
                 your card stops working, or the ATMs run out of money, you’ll be glad you did.
                 Some  stash spots may include socks, under shoe inserts, a toiletry bag,
                  around the frame of a backpack, even sewn behind a patch on your bag.
                </p> </li>
            <li><p><b>Be Happy</b>
                  Don't get pissed off just cause you weren't able to visit all the places you had initially planned.You are not on an amazing race around the world.Just relax and enjoy your trip!</p> </li>
            </ul>
